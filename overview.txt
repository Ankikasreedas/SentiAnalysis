Here I have perfomed sentiment analysis on a Flipkart Product review. I have acessed the data from
Flipkart website by web scraping.
Here all the reviews will be extracted
from the site and will be saved to .csv file.
After this, the sentiment analysis is performed in each review and the compound sentiment, positivity,
negativity and neutrality is displayed for each review.
At last, I have measured the accuracy of the results to see how much accurate the model is.
